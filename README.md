# Oscillon-formation-and-decay
This repository contains codes and data related to the study of oscillon formation and their decay during preheating in $\alpha$-attractor inflation models. The results stored in this repository are based on elaborate 3d numerical lattice simulations that are run using the publicly available lattice simulation code CosmoLattice.
